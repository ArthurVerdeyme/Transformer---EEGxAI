# Transformer---EEGxAI
Transformer-based prediction and explanation pipeline for EEG-derived features

# EEG Transformer + SHAP

This project builds a machine learning pipeline for classifying states of consciousness from EEG-derived features using a transformer-based model. Predictions are explained using SHAP for interpretability in clinical settings.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: raw or synthetic EEG-derived features
- `notebooks/`: development notebooks
- `src/`: source code for training and explaining models
- `plots/`: figures generated for SHAP and performance analysis

## Goals

- Train a transformer or strong ML model on EEG graph features
- Use SHAP to explain predictions at global and local levels
- Provide interpretable results for clinical insight

## Status

ðŸ”§ In progress â€” dataset generation and pipeline implementation underway.
